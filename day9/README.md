# Day 9

## Description
Working in FurnitORe is stressful, you know?

Every day, we receive orders requiring different-sized rectangular pieces cut from large sheets of material.

The sheets have a fixed width and height, and cutting waste directly affects our profitability.

To stay competitive, we need to pack these pieces efficiently.

Every unused area on a sheet represents wasted money, so we want to minimize that waste.

Can you help me solve this problem?

Here you can find an instance of this problem.

PS: how would you handle irregularly shaped items?
