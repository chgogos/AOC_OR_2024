# Day 2

## Description
My friend VictORia and I are planning a road trip.

We want to drive from Madrid to Copenhagen and we've seen there are a lot of ways to do it.

Most probably, even if we wanted to go through Budapest, we cannot go that path. We have a limited budget for fuel of 73â‚¬, and we want to get the shortest possible way.

Can you help me solve this problem?
