Hi, I'm SalvadOR, responsible for creating a school timetable to organize classes, teachers, and rooms for an upcoming semester.

We have some strict requirements to meet. This is a very hard problem we face every year, and I need your help to design an optimal timetable.

Here's the situation:

There are 4 classes, each requiring specific teaching sessions.
There are 4 teachers, and each teacher has assigned subjects to teach.
There are 4 rooms, and only one class can occupy a room during any given period.
The timetable spans 30 periods, and we must ensure that all requirements are met without any conflicts or overlaps.
I desperately need a timetable that satisfies all requirements (each class meets with the right teacher in the right room the required number of times), avoiding any type of clashes such as double-booking a teacher, room, or class during the same period.

We say a timetable is optimized when it minimizes idle periods and maximizes resource utilization (teachers and rooms).

Can you help me solve this problem?
